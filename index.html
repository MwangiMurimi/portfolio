      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>A young, budding programmer, I was born in 2000 in Nairobi, Kenya. I am a hardworking, leadership-minded, versatile African and aside from speaking three languages (English, Kiswahili and French), I have a firm understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript and an array of soft skills under my arm such as problem solving skills, interpersonal skills, leadership skills and a strong work ethic.</p>
      <p>My greatest attribute is my willingness to learn; after all, the biggest room in the world is room for improvement.</p>
      <p>I am currently a student at <a href="http://moringaschool.com">Moringa School</a>.</p>
